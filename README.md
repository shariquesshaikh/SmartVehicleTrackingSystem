Smart Criminal Recognition System (Veresys)

With the advent of digital monitoring technology, it has become easier to track and gather details of scenes and culprits of any potential crimes. CCTV cameras have been widely and effectively used to gather evidence for these crimes. However, there still lacks an effective system to track down vehicles that commit any of these crimes which can thus automate the process of tracking down suspected vehicles and reduce police labour. 

Our aim is to design an Advanced Vehicle Tracking System which makes use of the already installed CCTV Surveillance Cameras to locate a Vehicle blacklisted by the Police Department and to report this information in Real-time to the appropriate authorities. This is accomplished using the latest computer-vision based Machine Learning APIs and Open-source Image Processing Tools which are available in their optimised stage. This ensures that we are not relying on outdated technologies and enables us to get more processing done in less time. Our system will be well-trained using different datasets available online in order to detect and recognize each and every attribute of a vehicle such as license plate, model, type of vehicle, speed, dents, peculiar attachments and accessories. This allows our model to be able to track a vehicle even if some of its attributes, such as license plate, are not clearly visible. As this process involves a great amount of processing power, it will be implemented using Cloud Processing. The software will be available to all police stations and authorised officers with a secure access-control system in their computers, portable devices and vehicles. The database will contain the information of all vehicles recorded by the CCTV cameras at certain locations in textual as well as video format for future investigations to help find the past occurrences of any vehicle in a particular area in less time. 

With real-time Vehicle Tracking and Instantaneous Notification provided to the authorities, we are able to counter the limitations of the existing crime tracking technologies.
